# Project ChemoGenesis

Welcome to **Project ChemoGenesis**, an immersive 3D exploration of planetary systems and deep-sea organisms, created as part of the **NASA Space Apps Challenge**.

## Features

- **3D Planetary Visualization**: Explore Mars, Kepler-22b, and Europa using dynamic 3D models rendered via Three.js.
- **Organism Exploration**: Learn about chemosynthetic organisms like tube worms and Yeti crabs through interactive visualizations.
- **Responsive Design**: The site is optimized for different devices and includes visually appealing transitions and effects.
- **Animations and Controls**: Interactive controls allow users to manipulate 3D models and explore scientific data in an engaging manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D planet models and animations.
- **GSAP**: For smooth animations and transitions of the 3D models.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Structure and styling of the website, ensuring responsiveness and modern design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and integration of the 3D components.

## Files Overview

- **index.html**: Contains the homepage with a 3D model of a planet, where users can observe and interact with the animation.
- **tour.html**: Displays information about chemosynthetic organisms, their habitats, and adaptations【7†source】.
- **explore.html**: Highlights planetary exploration data, featuring Mars, Kepler-22b, and Europa【8†source】.
- **style.css**: Provides styling for the website, including layout, fonts, and animations【9†source】.
- **JavaScript Files**: Handles 3D rendering (e.g., using Three.js, GLTFLoader, OrbitControls) and dynamic animations of planets and sections.
